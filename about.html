                    We have been serving the West Ward of Easton for 60 years. The West Ward is still considered to be
                    the most challenging and diverse neighborhood within the City of Easton and is comprised of 11,500
                    residents, including 1000 children and youth. These are the children most in need.
                </p>
                <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                <p>To be an organization that fosters the development and well-being of our community members.</p>
                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>To provide programs, resources, and role models in a safe haven that enhances the social, physical,
                    and mental well-being of youth and adults.</p>
                <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
                <p>
                    - Give children a safe after school place to do homework, participate in activities, and gain
                    important life skills.<br>
                    - Help children off the streets at the prime time of 3 to 6 PM to prevent juvenile crime and offer
                    an alternative to gangs and criminal activity.<br>
                    - Provide positive role models and programs to help nurture youth in need.<br>
                    - Help further educate the youth of today and aid in the social, physical, and mental development of
                    the next generation.
